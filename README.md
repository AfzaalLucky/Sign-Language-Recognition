# Sign Language Recognition

 - This project recognizes the various static symbols that are part of ASL and classifies them based on KNN algorithm.  
 - The [images](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0Bw239KLrN7zofmxvSmtsVHlrbkFRY1NwMjh2NFJGX1ZtY0lKOTR0REJnQnBUdVgyVDlMMkk&usp=sharing) were retrieved from a video, filmed at 640x480 using a mobile camera.  
 - Further image processing was done to retrieve ROIs from the images and resize them to create a uniform dataset for the pattern recognition algorithm.

**Libraries used:**

 - Image processing: OpenCV
 - Classification: Scikit-learn
